We live in an era when business events are everywhere. Apache Camel K integrations and event-driven services to help tie some of those events together. 

In this Solution Pattern, you will be helping with a virtual fruit stand and creating a simple Camel K integration that pulls fruit from an online source of fruit-related nutritional information.

== The Fruit Vendor

The Fruit Vendor offers a stall in the market and a veritable wonderland of options for shoppers in need of produce. 

The manager of the site has asked you to start to pull together information on their produce to help inform the buyer of nutritional details. Details such as:

* Calories
* Carbohydrates
* Fats
* Protein
* Sugar

=== The Solution

In this solution pattern, we will use the Fruityvice API service which is an Open API that provides nutritional data for all kinds of fruit. We can use this service to retrieve JSON-formatted data which will be used in the solution pattern. 

Fruityvice enables you to use a GET call and retrieve JSON around common fruits. For example, a GET about data for `Banana` returns:

....
{
    "genus": "Musa",
    "name": "Banana",
    "id": 1,
    "family": "Musaceae",
    "order": "Zingiberales",
    "nutritions": {
        "carbohydrates": 22,
        "protein": 1,
        "fat": 0.2,
        "calories": 96,
        "sugar": 17.2
    }
}
....

{bl}
We will use the fruit stand's Red Hat Integration (RHI) system which is already in place, create an event using Red Hat AMQ, and create a new Camel K route that performs the call to the Fruityvice API, processes the necessary JSON data, and adds a streamlined event to be used downstream.

== Creating a Project
:task-context: creating-a-project

This demonstration requires a single project with event streaming and camel k resources. We will create the `fruit-stand` project.

****
*Creating new projects in OpenShift*
****
Follow these steps to create a new eventing project:

. In the link:{openshift-host}/projects[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"], log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges.
. Create a new OpenShift project:
.. Click *Create Project*.
.. Enter a project named `fruit-stand` and click *Create*.
. Monitor the OpenShift Console until a green check mark is displayed next to the new project.

[type=verification]
Go to the link:{openshift-host}/projects[OpenShift, window="_blank"] console. Do you see your newly created project displayed in the *Projects* list?

[id='installing-operators']
== Installing Operators
:task-context: installing-operators

With the projects created, we can now install each of the following operators which we will need for each namespace:

* Red Hat Integration - Camel K Operator
* Red Hat Integration - AMQ Streams Operator

// These links should work, but it opens into an error state - do we have a better link to point to for these operators?
//* link:{https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/detail/5ef256e84a5747832973cc6b}[Red Hat Integration - Camel K Operator, window="_blank"]
//* link:{https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/detail/5ef20efd46bc301a95a1e9a4}[Red Hat Integration - AMQ Streams Operator, window="_blank"]

{bl}
Follow these steps to install the Camel K operator (cluster admin rights are necessary).

. Go to the OperatorHub in the link:{openshift-host}/operatorHub[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Make sure `fruit-stand` is selected as the project in the Project dropdown.
. In the *Filter by keyword* text box, enter `Camel K` to find the *Red Hat Integration - Camel K Operator*.
. Read the information about the Operator, and click *Install*. This displays the *Create Operator Subscription* page.
. Select the following subscription setting:
** *Installation Mode>A specific namespace on the cluster>fruit-stand*
. Click *Subscribe*. This displays the *Operators* > *Installed Operators* page.
. Wait a few moments until the *Status* for the Camel K Operator displays *Succeeded* and the subscription is *Up to Date*. A green check mark will also be displayed next to the new operator.

{bl}
Repeat the process to install the *Red Hat Integration - AMQ Streams Operator* into the `fruit-stand` namespace.

[type=verification]
Go to the link:{openshift-host}/k8s/all-namespaces/operators.coreos.com~v1alpha1~ClusterServiceVersion[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"]. Do you see your newly installed operators displayed in the *Installed Operators* list on the namespaces you selected?
